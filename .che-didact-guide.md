## Adding or editing new plugins
Since December 2020, populating the plugin registry is about editing the file `che-theia-plugins.yaml`.

- [Open che-theia-plugins.yaml](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=che-plugin-registry%2Fche-theia-plugins.yaml&number=2)

## Building
The predefined task `1. build` will start building the plugin registry. The result of the build is available in the project explorer `build` folder.

- [Run the `1. build` predefined task](didact://?commandId=workbench.action.tasks.runTask&text=1.%20build)

## Preview the plugin registry
The predefined task `2. copy to che-plugin-registry server` will copy the `build/v3` folder to the container that runs a instance of the che-plugin-registry webserver. The task will also invite you to open the updated registry in a preview tab.

- [Run the `2. copy to che-plugin-registry server` predefined task](didact://?commandId=workbench.action.tasks.runTask&text=2.%20copy%20to%20che-plugin-registry%20server)

That's it
