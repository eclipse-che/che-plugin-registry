# Welcome to the che-plugin-registry workspace

This guide contains the instructions to build and run the che-plugin-registry in this workspace.

The guide is interactive. You can click on the below links to open files or start the predefined commands.

Enjoy!

## Adding or editing plugins and editors
Since December 2020, populating the plugin registry is about editing the file `che-theia-plugins.yaml`. Editors could be customized from the file `che-editors.yaml`.

- [Open che-theia-plugins.yaml](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=che-plugin-registry%2Fche-theia-plugins.yaml&number=2)
- [Open che-editors.yaml](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=che-plugin-registry%2Fche-editors.yaml&number=2)

More details on how to add plugins and editors: [Open CONTRIBUTE.md](didact://?commandId=markdown.showPreview&projectFilePath=che-plugin-registry%2FCONTRIBUTE.md)


## Building
The predefined task `1. build` will start building the plugin registry. The result of the build is available in the project explorer `output` folder, child of che-plugin-registry folder.

- [Run the `1. build` predefined task](didact://?commandId=workbench.action.tasks.runTask&text=1.%20build)
- [Open the generated `che-plugin-registry/output/v3/plugins/index.json`](didact://?commandId=vscode.open&projectFilePath=che-plugin-registry%2Foutput%2Fv3%2Fplugins%2Findex.json&number=2)

Generation could take some time, be patient :)

## Preview the plugin registry
The predefined task `2. copy to che-plugin-registry server` will copy the `output/v3` folder to the container that runs a instance of the che-plugin-registry webserver running within this workspace. The task will also invite you to open the updated registry in a preview tab.

- [Run the `2. copy to che-plugin-registry server` predefined task](didact://?commandId=workbench.action.tasks.runTask&text=2.%20copy%20to%20che-plugin-registry%20server)


## Publish to surge.sh
The predefined task `3. publish to surge.sh` will publish the `output` folder to https://surge.sh/. You will be invited to create an account or login.

- [Run the `3. publish to surge.sh` predefined task](didact://?commandId=workbench.action.tasks.runTask&text=3.%20publish%20to%20surge.sh)

Use the deployed custom plugin registry in your devfiles. For instance:

```yaml
  - id: ms-vscode/vscode-github-pullrequest/latest
    type: chePlugin
    registryUrl: 'https://che-plugin-registry-dev-tgtmd.surge.sh/v3'
```
or globally in a Che server with `pluginRegistryUrl`: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/configuring-the-che-installation/ 

That's it
