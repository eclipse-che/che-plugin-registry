# dependabot is not handling Yarn v2/3, workarounding the PR 
# https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1297

# Note: We use the `pull_request_target` event due to GitHub security measures.
#       It is important to ensure we don't execute any untrusted PR code in this context.

    # IMPORTANT: setting YARN_ENABLE_SCRIPTS=false is critical to ensure that untrusted
    # PRs can't add an npm package and then use that to execute untrusted code in
    # a trusted context. See links at the top of this workflow for further details.
