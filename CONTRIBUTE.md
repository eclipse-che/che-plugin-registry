# Adding a VS Code extension to Che
Che uses a similar system to OpenVSX when it comes to adding VS Code extensions. In the root of this repository is a [`che-theia-plugins.yaml`](./che-theia-plugins.yaml) file. In order to add/update a VS Code extension in Che, simply add/edit this file with the relevant extension information.

Here is the expected format of a [`che-theia-plugins.yaml`](./che-theia-plugins.yaml) plugin entry:

```yaml
  - repository:
      # Repository URL to clone and from
      url: https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java
      # Tag or SHA1 ID of the upstream repository that hosts the extension, usually corresponding to a version/snapshot/release.
      revision: v0.69.0
    # Direct link(s) to the vsix files included with this plugin. The vsix build by the repository specified must be listed first
    extensions:
      - https://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/static/jdt.ls/stable/java-0.69.0-2547.vsix
      - https://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/vscode/3rdparty/vscode-java-debug/vscode-java-debug-0.26.0.vsix
      - https://open-vsx.org/api/vscjava/vscode-java-test/0.24.0/file/vscjava.vscode-java-test-0.24.0.vsix
```

Here are all the supported values, including optional ones:

```yaml
  # (OPTIONAL) The ID of the plugin, useful if a plugin has multiple entries for one repository (for example, Java 8 vs. Java 11)
  - id: redhat/java11

  - repository:
      # Repository URL to clone and from

      # Tag or SHA1 ID of the upstream repository that hosts the extension, usually corresponding to a version/snapshot/release.

# Adding a Che Plugin to Che (Not a VS Code extension or a Theia Plug-in)
Che supports plug-ins. These plug-ins are not VS Code extensions, and only bring new endpoints and containers. In the root of this repository is a [`che-plugins.yaml`](./che-plugins.yaml) file. In order to add/update a Che Plugin in Che, simply add/edit this file with the relevant plug-in information.

## Sidecars
Sometimes a VS Code extension will need to run in a sidecar container. Any plugin can run in any of the sidecar containers already defined in this repository. If an extension needs a specialized container not already available, then a new sidecar can be contributed.

### How It Works
All sidecar definitions are located in the `sidecars/` directory of this repository. Each directory within the `sidecars/` directory represents a sidecar container, and the name of that sub-directory will be the name of the container. For example, the directory `sidecars/java` means there is a sidecar container named `java`.

There are three things needed when contributing a sidecar:
* The `Dockerfile` that builds the container image
* A `PLATFORMS` file which lists all the architectures your container will be built for
* An entrypoint script, which allows your sidecar image to be used in Che. Here is an [example](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/blob/master/sidecars/node/etc/entrypoint.sh) of such a script. The script needs to be included in the sidecar directory, and also be added to the `Dockerfile` via the `ADD` instruction. Additional scripts may also be contributed and added.

### Contribution Flow
At this time, updating/adding a new plugin and sidecar requires two PRs.

#### PR 1: Sidecar Changes
1. Make the changes necessary to add the sidecar, or update an existing one.
2. Open a PR with the changes.
3. A PR check will run to validate that the sidecar builds. Reviewers will then review the PR.
4. When the PR is merged, a CI job will build the image, and push it to `quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-sidecar`. Such CI jobs run via GitHub action and can be monitored [here](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/actions).

The resulting image built and pushed via GitHub action will be named according to the directory name, and the shortened commit hash that last changed its definition. For example, if commit `b8f0528` was a change made to the `java` sidecar, then the resulting image from that change will be named `java-b8f0528`. You can check for new images by checking the [quay.io web interface](https://quay.io/repository/eclipse/che-plugin-sidecar?tag=latest&tab=tags), or by checking the console log of the GitHub action job that built and pushed the image.

One PR can modify/add/remove multiple sidecars, they do not need to be split up into separate PRs.

#### PR 2: Plugin Changes
Now that the sidecar image has been built and pushed, the second PR can make use of it. The second PR will be the one that modifies the [`che-theia-plugins.yaml`](./che-theia-plugins.yaml) file.

## Registry Publishing
### Pull Requests
All PRs in the plugin registry are published to [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/), for ease of testing. This means that a CI job will automatically build the plugin registry with a PR's changes, and publish it. The resulting link can then be used to test the PR inside Che, without needing to create a `meta.yaml` file.

The job names are `surge(alpine)` and `surge(rhel)`. Clicking on `Details` in the GitHub PR view will take you to the surge.sh link. Alternatively, you can look at the link directly, which is in the following format: `https://pr-check-<PR_NUMBER>-<alpine|rhel>-che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/`

For example, alpine build of PR 805 would be hosted at: https://pr-check-805-alpine-che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/

### Nightly
A nightly build of the plugin registry is published on both [surge.sh](https://che-plugin-registry-main.surge.sh/), and [GitHub Pages](https://eclipse-che.github.io/che-plugin-registry/main/). Both are updated upon every commit merged to the main branch.

### Versioned Releases
Versioned releases of the che-plugin-registry are also published to GitHub Pages. The version of the release is name of the last folder in the URL.

For example, the `7.29.0` version of the plugin registry would be published at https://eclipse-che.github.io/che-plugin-registry/7.29.0/
