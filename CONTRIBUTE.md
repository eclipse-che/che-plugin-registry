# Adding a VS Code extension to the embedded open-vsx registry
In the root of this repository is a [`openvsx-sync.json`](./openvsx-sync.json) file. In order to add/update a VS Code extension in embedded open-vsx registry, simply edit this file with the relevant extension information.

Here is the expected format of a [`openvsx-sync.json`](./openvsx-sync.json) plugin entry:

```json
  {
    "id": "publisher.name",
    "download": "url_to_downlod_vsix",
    "version": "extension_version"
  }
```

Here are all the supported values, including optional ones:

```json
  {
    // (REQUIRED) The ID of the plugin. When identifying an extension, provide the full name of the form publisher.extension, for example ms-python.python
    // The latest extension version on open-vsx.org is the default. Alternatively, you can add "version": "<extension_version>" on a new line to specify a version.
    "id": "<publisher>.<extension>",
    // (OPTIONAL) The link to the vsix file of the extension (if not provided, the extension will be downloaded)
    "download": "<url_to_download_vsix_file>",
    // (OPTIONAL) The version of the extension (if not provided, the latest version will be used)
    "version": "<extension_version>"
  }
```

# Adding a Che Editor to Che
Che supports multiple editors and each workspace can use its own editor. In the root of this repository is a [`che-editors.yaml`](./che-editors.yaml) file. In order to add/update a Che Editor in Che, simply add/edit this file with the relevant editor information.

Here is the expected format of a [`che-editors.yaml`](./che-editors.yaml) editor entry:

```

To run a workspace using a new editor you need to build a link:
`https://<che-host>/#<sample-git-repo>?che-editor=<editor-definition-raw-url>`. Where:
- `che-host` is an Eclipse Che instance like `https://devspaces.apps.sandbox-m4.g2pi.p1.openshiftapps.com/`
- `git-repo` is a repository with a project that should be cloned into the workspace
- `editor-definition-raw-url` is an URL to the raw content of your editor definition 

## Registry Publishing
### Pull Requests
All PRs in the plugin registry are published to [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/), for ease of testing. This means that a CI job will automatically build the plugin registry with a PR's changes, and publish it. The resulting link can then be used to test the PR inside Che, without needing to create a `devfile.yaml` file.

The job names are `surge`. Clicking on `Details` in the GitHub PR view will take you to the surge.sh link. Alternatively, you can look at the link directly, which is in the following format: `https://pr-check-<PR_NUMBER>-che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/`

For example, build of PR 805 would be hosted at: https://pr-check-805-che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/

### Next
A next build of the plugin registry is published on both [surge.sh](https://che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/), and [GitHub Pages](https://eclipse-che.github.io/che-plugin-registry/main/). Both are updated upon every commit merged to the main branch.

The editor definition can be found by URL: `https://pr-check-<PR_NUMBER>-che-plugin-registry.surge.sh/v3/plugins/<publisher>/<name>/<version>/devfile.yaml`

### Versioned Releases
Versioned releases of the che-plugin-registry are also published to GitHub Pages. The version of the release is name of the last folder in the URL.

For example, the `7.29.0` version of the plugin registry would be published at https://eclipse-che.github.io/che-plugin-registry/7.29.0/
