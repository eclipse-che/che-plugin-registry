# Eclipse Che Plugin Registry

This repository holds ready-to-use plugins for different languages and technologies. A [nightly build](https://che-plugin-registry-main.surge.sh/) of this registry is published on surge.sh.

## Building and publishing third party VSIX extensions for plugin registry
See: https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/blob/master/devdoc/building/build-vsix-extension.adoc


## Prerequisites
 - nodejs 12.x and yarn v1

## Build registry container image

This repository contains a `build.sh` script at its root that can be used to build the registry:
```
Usage: ./build.sh [OPTIONS]
Options:
    --help
        Print this message.
    --tag, -t [TAG]
        Docker image tag to be used for image; default: 'nightly'
    --registry, -r [REGISTRY]
        Docker registry to be used for image; default 'quay.io'
    --organization, -o [ORGANIZATION]
        Docker image organization to be used for image; default: 'eclipse'
    --offline
        Build offline version of registry, with all artifacts included
        cached in the registry; disabled by default.
    --rhel
        Build using the rhel.Dockerfile (UBI images) instead of Alpine
    --skip-oci-image
        Build artifacts but do not create the image        
```

This script listens to the `BUILDER` variable, and will use the tool specified there to build the image. For example:
```sh
BUILDER=buildah ./build.sh
```

will force the build to use `buildah`. If `BUILDER` is not specified, the script will try to use `podman` by default. If `podman` is not installed, then `buildah` will be chosen. If neither `podman` nor `buildah` are installed, the script will finally try to build with `docker`.

### Offline and airgapped registry images

Using the `--offline` option in `build.sh` will build the registry to contain all referenced extension artifacts (i.e. all `.theia` and `.vsix` archives). The offline version of the plugin registry is useful in network-limited scenarios, as it avoids the need to download plugin extensions from the outside internet.

## Deploy the registry to OpenShift

You can deploy the registry to Openshift as follows:

```bash
  oc new-app -f deploy/openshift/che-plugin-registry.yml \
             -p IMAGE="quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry" \
             -p IMAGE_TAG="nightly" \
             -p PULL_POLICY="Always"
```

## Run Eclipse Che plugin registry on Kubernetes

You can deploy Che plugin registry on Kubernetes using [helm](https://docs.helm.sh/). For example if you want to deploy it in the namespace `kube-che` and you are using `minikube` you can use the following command.

```bash
NAMESPACE="kube-che"
DOMAIN="$(minikube ip).nip.io"
helm upgrade --install che-plugin-registry \
    --debug \
    --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set global.ingressDomain=${DOMAIN} \
    deploy/kubernetes/che-plugin-registry/
```

You can use the following command to uninstall it.

```bash
helm delete --purge che-plugin-registry
```

## Run the registry

```bash
docker run -it  --rm  -p 8080:8080 quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:nightly
```

## Plugin meta YAML structure

```

1 - Category must be equal to one of the following: "Editor", "Debugger", "Formatter", "Language", "Linter", "Snippet", "Theme", "Other"

2 - firstPublicationDate is not required to be present in YAML, as if not present, it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

3 - latestUpdateDate is not required to be present in YAML, as it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

4 - extensions starting with `relative:extension` are resolved relative to the path of `index.json` -- e.g. `v3`. This is primarily to support an offline or airgapped instance of the plugin registry. See [Offline and airgapped registry images](#offline-and-airgapped-registry-images) for details.

Note that the `spec` section above comes from the older `che-plugin.yaml` spec. The `endpoints`, `containers`, and `workspaceEnv` are passed back to Che server and are used to define the sidecar that is added to the workspace.

At the moment, some of these fields (that are related to plugin viewer) are validated during the Plugin Registry dockerimage build.

## CI
The following [CentOS CI jobs](https://ci.centos.org/) are associated with the repository:

- [`master`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-build-master/) - builds CentOS images on each commit to the [`master`](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/tree/master) branch and pushes them to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse).
- [`nightly`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-nightly/) - builds CentOS images and pushes them to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse) on a daily basis from the [`master`](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/tree/master) branch. The `nightly` version of the plugin registry is used by default by the `nightly` version of the [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che), which is also built on a daily basis by the [`all-che-docker-images-nightly`](all-che-docker-images-nightly/) CI job.
- [`release`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-release/) - builds CentOS and corresponding RHEL images from the [`release`](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/tree/release) branch. CentOS images are public and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse). RHEL images are also pushed to quay.io, but to the private repositories and then used by the ["Hosted Che"](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/) plugin registry - https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/.
- [`release-preview`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-release-preview/) - builds CentOS and corresponding RHEL images from the [`release-preview`](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry/tree/release-preview) branch and automatically updates ["Hosted Che"](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/) staging plugin registry deployment based on the new version of images - https://che-plugin-registry.prod-preview.openshift.io/. CentOS images are public and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse). RHEL images are also pushed to quay.io, but to the private repositories.
