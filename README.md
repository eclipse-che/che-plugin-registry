# Eclipse Che plugin registry

## Build Eclipse Che plugin registry container image

Most of the time you won't need to rebuild the image because we build ```quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:nightly``` after every commit in master. In case you needed to change the content of the registry (e.g. add or modify some plugins meta.yaml) you can build your own image executing:

```shell
docker build --no-cache -t quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:nightly --target registry .
```

Where `--no-cache` is needed to prevent usage of cached layers with plugin registry files.
Useful when you change plugin metadata files and rebuild the image.

Note that the Dockerfiles feature multi-stage build, so it requires Docker version 17.05 or higher.

### Offline and airgapped registry images

It's possible to build an image for the plugin registry that includes all referenced extension artifacts (i.e. all `.theia` and `.vsix` archives). This is done using the same `Dockerfile`, but performs additional steps to download artifacts and rewrite the plugin meta.yamls to use files cached in `v3/resources/`.

```shell
docker build --no-cache -t quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:offline --target offline-registry .
```

Note that support for relative extensions was added in `v0.20` of the plugin broker.

## Run Eclipse Che plugin registry on OpenShift

You can deploy Che plugin registry on Openshift with command.

```bash
  oc new-app -f openshift/che-plugin-registry.yml \
             -p IMAGE="quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry" \
             -p IMAGE_TAG="nightly" \
             -p PULL_POLICY="IfNotPresent"
```

## Run Eclipse Che plugin registry on Kubernetes

You can deploy Che plugin registry on Kubernetes using [helm](https://docs.helm.sh/). For example if you want to deploy it in the namespace `kube-che` and you are using `minikube` you can use the following command.

```bash

NAMESPACE="kube-che"
DOMAIN="$(minikube ip).nip.io"
helm upgrade --install che-plugin-registry \
    --debug \
    --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set global.ingressDomain=${DOMAIN} \
    ./kubernetes/che-plugin-registry/

```

You can use the following command to uninstall it.

```bash

helm delete --purge che-plugin-registry

```

## Run Eclipse Che plugin registry using Docker

```bash
docker run -it  --rm  -p 8080:8080 quay.io/eclipse/che-plugin-registry:nightly
```

    - vscode:extension/redhat.vscode-xml # example
    - https://github.com/redhat-developer/omnisharp-theia-plugin/releases/download/v0.0.1/omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia # example
    - relative:extension/resources/java-0.46.0-1549.vsix # example; see [4]
```

1 - Category must be equal to one of the following: "Editor", "Debugger", "Formatter", "Language", "Linter", "Snippet", "Theme", "Other"

2 - firstPublicationDate is not required to be present in YAML, as if not present, it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

3 - latestUpdateDate is not required to be present in YAML, as it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

4 - extensions starting with `relative:extension` are resolved relative to the path of `index.json` -- e.g. `v3`. This is primarily to support an offline or airgapped instance of the plugin registry. See [Offline and airgapped registry images](#offline-and-airgapped-registry-images) for details.

Note that the `spec` section above comes from the older `che-plugin.yaml` spec. The `endpoints`, `containers`, and `workspaceEnv` are passed back to Che server and are used to define the sidecar that is added to the workspace.

At the moment, some of these fields (that are related to plugin viewer) are validated during the Plugin Registry dockerimage build.

## CI
The following [CentOS CI jobs](https://ci.centos.org/) are associated with the repository:

- [`master`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-build-master/) - builds CentOS images on each commit to the [`master`](https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/tree/master) branch and pushes them to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse).
- [`nightly`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-nightly/) - builds CentOS images and pushes them to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse) on a daily basis from the [`master`](https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/tree/master) branch. The `nightly` version of the plugin registry is used by default by the `nightly` version of the [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che), which is also built on a daily basis by the [`all-che-docker-images-nightly`](all-che-docker-images-nightly/) CI job.
- [`release`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-release/) - builds CentOS and corresponding RHEL images from the [`release`](https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/tree/release) branch. CentOS images are public and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse). RHEL images are also pushed to quay.io, but to the private repositories and then used by the ["Hosted Che"](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/) plugin registry - https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/.
- [`release-preview`](https://ci.centos.org/job/devtools-che-plugin-registry-release-preview/) - builds CentOS and corresponding RHEL images from the [`release-preview`](https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/tree/release-preview) branch and automatically updates ["Hosted Che"](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/) staging plugin registry deployment based on the new version of images - https://che-plugin-registry.prod-preview.openshift.io/. CentOS images are public and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/eclipse). RHEL images are also pushed to quay.io, but to the private repositories.
